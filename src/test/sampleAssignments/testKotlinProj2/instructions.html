    <h2>Sample Kotlin Assignment</h2>
    <p>This is just a very simple Kotlin assignment just to experiment with Drop Project</p>
    <p>The source of this assignment is available on
        <a href="https://github.com/drop-project-edu/sampleKotlinAssignment">https://github.com/drop-project-edu/sampleKotlinAssignment</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Create a Kotlin project in your IDE with the structure depicted at the end of this page. In particular, you must create a package
            <code>org.dropproject.samples.samplekotlinassignment</code> and create a <code>Main.kt</code> in that package.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Within your <code>Main.kt</code> file, implement a top-level function to calculate the
                maximum value on an array of integers. This function must have the following signature:<br/>
                <code>findMax(numbers: Array&lt;Int&gt;): Int</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Create a zip file of your project and drop it on the area above these instructions.
                In a few seconds, Drop Project will give you a report with some metrics about your project.
                <br/>If you don't feel like coding this stuff, you can grab a pre-built submission
