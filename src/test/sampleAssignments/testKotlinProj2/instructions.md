# Sample Kotlin Assignment

This is just a very simple Kotlin assignment just to experiment with Drop Project.

The source of this assignment is available on https://github.com/drop-project-edu/sampleKotlinAssignment

## Instructions

* Create a Kotlin project in your IDE with the structure depicted at the end of this page. 
In particular, you must create a package `org.dropproject.samples.samplekotlinassignment` and
create a `Main.kt` in that package.


* Within your `Main.kt` file, implement a top-level function to calculate the
  maximum value on an array of integers. This function must have the following signature:

  `findMax(numbers: Array<Int>): Int`


* Create a zip file of your project and drop it on the area above these instructions.
In a few seconds, Drop Project will give you a report with some metrics about your project.
If you don't feel like coding this stuff, you can grab a pre-built submission 
[here](https://github.com/drop-project-edu/sampleKotlinAssignment/raw/master/sampleKotlinSubmission.zip).
